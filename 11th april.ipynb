    "## An ensemble technique in machine learning is a method of combining multiple models to obtain better predictive performance than could be obtained from any of the individual models alone. The basic idea is that by combining the predictions of multiple models, the errors of individual models can be cancelled out, resulting in more accurate predictions.\n",
    "## Ensemble techniques are widely used in machine learning because they often produce better results than any single model. The two main types of ensemble techniques are:\n",
    "## 1. Bagging: In this technique, multiple copies of the same model are trained on different subsets of the training data, and the predictions of the individual models are averaged to obtain the final prediction. This approach can reduce the variance of the model and prevent overfitting.\n",
    "## 2. Boosting: In this technique, a sequence of weak models is trained on weighted versions of the training data. The weights are adjusted after each model is trained to give more importance to the examples that were misclassified by the previous models. This approach can reduce the bias of the model and improve its overall accuracy.\n",
    "## Other types of ensemble techniques include stacking, where the predictions of multiple models are used as inputs to a meta-model, and mixture of experts, where different models are used to make predictions in different parts of the input space."

    "## The basic idea behind bagging is to reduce the variance of the model by introducing randomization in the training process. Each copy of the model is trained on a different bootstrap sample of the training data, which is created by sampling the training data with replacement. Because each bootstrap sample is different, each copy of the model will be slightly different as well. By combining the predictions of multiple models trained on different samples of the data, the overall prediction is less sensitive to small variations in the training data.\n",
    "## Bagging is typically used with models that have high variance, such as decision trees, where small changes in the training data can result in very different trees. By averaging the predictions of multiple trees trained on different subsets of the data, the overall variance of the ensemble is reduced, resulting in a more stable and accurate model.\n",

In each iteration of the boosting algorithm, the weights of the training examples are adjusted to give more importance to the examples that were misclassified by the previous models.

In such cases, the added complexity and computational cost of the ensemble may not be worth the small improvement in performance.\n",
